## PROBLEM STATEMENT
It was imperative to decipher the generator run time in order to put a lid on the incessant problems arising from the more frequent maintenance checks being carried out on the generator thereby increasing the monthly running cost. This analysis will show the present run time of each generating set, the times of day they were most used, the number of days each was used, the times the generator came on and the percentage usage for each set.
